## About this project

This project aims to design and develop a smart automated sorting and packing machine capable of accurately weighing and packing items.

The machine will be equipped with sensors  to detect and sort items based on their size, shape, and weight. It will also be able to pack the items in a variety of packaging materials such as boxes or bags, depending on the customer's needs. Additionally, the machine will be integrated with a software system that will manage the inventory and keep track of the items being packed .

## Project tasks

The tasks for this project can be found at the following link: [https://www.notion.so/System-design-and-hardware-requirements-d707a1a88acf4a1f98fed18a23bbc96e](https://www.notion.so/System-design-and-hardware-requirements-d707a1a88acf4a1f98fed18a23bbc96e)

The project tasks involve designing and developing the hardware and software components of the sorting and packing machine, as well as testing and refining the machine to ensure accuracy and efficiency. The team will also need to create user manuals and training materials for operators of the machine.

The project tasks involve managing the budget and procurement of materials needed for the hardware components, as well as coordinating with suppliers and manufacturers for the fabrication of the machine. The team will also need to schedule and manage installation of the machine at the customer's location, as well as provide ongoing technical support as needed.
